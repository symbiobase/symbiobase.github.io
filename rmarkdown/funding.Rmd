symbioBase is funded by a [Australian Biological Resources Study](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/science-research/abrs/grants) (ABRS) National Taxonomy Research Grant Program (***NTRGP***) fellowship:


**Principal Investigator:** E. Sampayo\
**Institution**: The University of Queensland

**Project Title**: "Systematic and taxonomic analyses of eastern Australian Symbiodiniaceae: the unification of research on coral-algal mutualisms"\
**Project Length**: 2020-2024\
**Amount:** \$330,000 over three years\

**Project Summary:** Special mutualisms between reef corals and single-celled dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) have persisted for millions of years. These symbioses, which create diverse and productive coral reef ecosystems in warm nutrient-poor oceans, are now under threat from global climate change. The future of reef ecosystems depends upon the capacity of corals to adapt to rising temperatures, and the stress tolerance of corals has been directly linked to the identity of their resident symbionts. Thus, knowledge of the ecology, biogeography, and evolution of these mutualistic dinoflagellates is essential for predicting the future of coral communities and the reefs they construct. Despite the importance of Symbiodiniaceae in maintaining coral health, progress in research is challenged by the lack of a basic taxonomy. Without morphological features to recognize species, recent genetics- based approaches have shown to be highly efficient in resolving species. A recent major systematic revision has erected numerous genera in the family Symbiodiniaceae. However, scores of likely species from these various genera require formal binomials and are needed for scientific research to proceed. Over 100 species of symbiotic dinoflagellate are likely to be associated with eastern Australian reef invertebrates, many in the genus Cladocopium. With access to the largest sample collection of GBR corals (7500 specimens), this project will (a) resolve the taxonomic status of eastern Australian Symbiodiniaceae, (b) develop a cost-effective genetic toolkit to rapidly delineate these species and (c) establish a molecular- taxonomic key and database including all biogeographic and ecological information. The significance in removing taxonomic uncertainty will provide a sound and standardized framework for research, solidifying our understanding on the physiology, ecology, and adaptive capacities of reef building corals under future climate change.
