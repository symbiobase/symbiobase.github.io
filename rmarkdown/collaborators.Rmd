Eugenia is a Research Fellow at the University of Queensland She completed her PhD in 2008 at the University of Queensland, after which she worked in the USA and Japan before returning to the Australia in 2012. Eugeniaâ€™s research focuses on the ecology and functional significance of the symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium) that associate with many marine invertebrates, including scleractinian corals. She is particularly interested symbioses ecology and evolution, species ranges and flexibility of symbiotic partnerships in the context of climate change. 

As an [ABRS NTRGP](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/science-research/abrs/grants), Eugenia is responsible for curation and taxonomic revision to Australian Symbiodiniaceae via Symbiobase. Through the extensive sample collection of high-latitude reefs, this research has led to the discovery of 17 new Cladocopium genotypes (Sampayo in prep).
