Eugenia is an ABRS-NTGRP
(<https://www.dcceew.gov.au/science-research/abrs/grants/awarded/2020-21>)
Research Fellow at the University of Queensland. Over the past 20 years,
Eugenia has worked on marine invertebrates across the Indo-Pacific Ocean
and Caribbean basin. Her research focuses on the evolutionary ecology,
biodiversity and species ranges of Symbiodiniaceae associated with
marine invertebrates, including scleractinian corals. Eugenia is
responsible for curating data into SymbioBase.

Todd is the founder of the current taxonomic framework for
Symbiodiniacaee. He revised the former genus *Symbiodinium* into the
family Symbiodiniaceae that now contains 11 genera. Todd is based at the
Pennsylvania State University (U.S.A.) where he leads the "Symbiosis &
Evolution Lab". He focuses on the evolutionary ecology, biogeography and
species diversity of marine invertebrate symbioses.

Zoe is an expert on Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral taxonomy,
systematics, population genetics, and conservation biology. She has
described several coral species and is responsible for over 50,000
Marine Invertebrates specimens as Curator of Marine Invertebrates at the
Western Australian Museum. Zoe holds a joint position at Curtin
University, where she leads the Coral Conservation and Research Group
within the Trace and Environmental DNA Laboratory. Zoe's work actively
engages with conservation, informing threatened species policies (IUCN
Coral Specialist Group) and working alongside marine park rangers and
managers (e.g. Ningaloo Reef, Kimberley).

Christian is a professor at the University of Konstanz (Germany) and
president of the International Society for Coral Reef Society (ICRS).
Christian's work integrates genomics approaches to gain an integrated
understanding of coral ecology and evolution. His work targets adaptive
capabilities and biotic response to environmental change from organismal
to ecosystem levels to provide guidance for conservation and sustainable
use of coral ecosystems.

Lisa is the Head of Aquatic Zoology and Curator of Molluscs at the
Western Australian Museum. Her work focuses on bivalve taxonomy and
systematics, with a specific interest in biogeography, evolution and
adaptation. Lisa serves as an expert for industry and government, and
has led major biodiversity discovery programs (e.g. "Bush Blitz",
"Westport Biodiversity Survey", Schmidt Ocean Institute expeditions).
Her work delivered thousands of data points on mollusc species
occurrences, many of which represent new records and new species, and
directly informed marine park management (Gascoyne Marine Park,
Kimberley Marine Parks). She is excited to increase knowledge of
molluscan symbioses with Symbiodiniaceae, with are sorely missing from
current biodiversity estimates (\<0.5% of data).
